I am working as an undergraduate research assistant at the BAIlab in Korea University Sejong Campus.

The data downloaded from the reference is a file that can be executed in MATLAB.

After downloading all the files in the [matlab](matlab) folder and running MatToTensor.m, the data and labels are divided into low-frequency, mid-frequency, and high-frequency bands and stored.

Then, by executing the training and testing codes in the [models](models) folder, the accuracy of models on the SSVEP dataset can be measured.
